Portfolio I made for myself to showcase the projects I've developed over the years and provide information about myself as well as my contact details. This is where everything I learnt about web developing is put to use. It was also used to experiment with different technologies that I wasn't able to do for coursework.

## [v1](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v1/)

I initially made [version 1](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v1/) in April 2015 to revise for a test for a unit during my degree on basic HTML &amp; CSS.

## [v2](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v2/)

In the summer of 2016 I decided to put the portfolio online, but I thought it needed major updates first. So I went and updated the site with new content &amp; features I have learnt in the past year also with some experiments. Therefore this was the start of [version 2](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v2/).

##### Work done in release:

-   An CMS page where projects have CRUD capabilities via an API &amp; database
-   The projects &amp; homepage display projects via API (Including a projects search)
-   3 custom built slide shows for display project images
-   New styling (integrated Bootstrap3, with some custom CSS3)
-   New content (Contact form, XML site map &amp; custom error pages)
-   Custom sticky footer

## [v3](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v3/)

In early 2017 I was coming to the end of my degree, I wanted to use my portfolio to aid getting my first graduate job, but also knew it needs to be top quality. Therefore prompting [version 3](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v3/) of my site. So this consisted of fresh new content also to showcase my expansive knowledge base I added more experiments that weren't learnt from education.

##### Work done in release:

-   Update styling (use SCSS and add animate.css &amp; wow.js)
-   AngularJS for the CMS
-   More accessible &amp; valid code
-   More feedback on user events &amp; system errors

## [v4](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v4/)

What started off [version 4](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v4/) was due to the fact, I had been in a commercial job developing, and now had experience of how sites/apps are developed on a production level, I thought I'd use that knowledge on my own site and do a major overhaul. This project started in the summer of 2017 and finished in the summer of 2018.

##### Work done in release:

-   All custom styling (remove Bootstrap3, animate.css &amp; wow.js)
-   Major update of content &amp; add new content
-   More secure API, CMS &amp; older projects
-   Update API URI structure
-   Add CMS page &amp; projects page rooting
-   SEO
-   General tidy up (code, file, folder structures &amp; minify asset files)
-   Use BEM &amp; use element classes not ID's

### [v4.1.0](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v4.1.0/)

At the end of 2018 I wanted to separate the API &amp; CMS away from the main Portfolio project and create projects for these 2 instead. This was done to separate the 3 as these have 3 different logic and usage, as well as enabling more maintainability for the future.

There was also a sub-aim which was to refactor the new version with more consistent standards throughout (for HTML, JS &amp; CSS/SCSS) so better overall code.
