# Portfolio

Portfolio I made for myself to showcase the projects I've developed, provide information about myself as well as my contact details. I like to use this as a place to experiment with things on.

[1.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v1) - I initially made this in April 2015 to revise for a test during my degree on basic HTML &amp; CSS.

[2.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v2) - In the summer of 2016 I wanted to put the portfolio online, but I thought it needed major updates, using everything I had learnt in the past year. The updates included adding a CMS backed by an API, all new content and new designs (using Bootstrap3).

[3.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v3) - Coming to the end of my degree in early 2017 I wanted to use my portfolio to aid getting my first graduate job, but knew it needs to be top quality therefore added new content, integrated SCSS, animate.css &amp; wow.js.



[4.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v4)

What started off version 4 was due to the fact, I had been in a commercial job developing, and now had experience of how sites/apps are developed on a production level, I thought I'd use that knowledge on my own site and do a major overhaul. This project started in the summer of 2017 and finished in the summer of 2018.

##### Work done in release:

- All custom styling (remove Bootstrap3, animate.css &amp; wow.js)
- Major update of content
- General refactor
- Use BEM &amp; use element classes not ID's
