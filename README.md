# Portfolio

Portfolio I've made for myself to showcase the projects I've developed, provide information about myself as well as my contact details. I like to use this as a place to experiment with things on.

### [1.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v1)

I initially made this in April 2015 to revise for a test during my degree on basic HTML &amp; CSS.

### [2.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v2)

In the summer of 2016 I wanted to put the portfolio online, but I thought it needed major updates, using everything I had learnt in the past year. The updates included adding a CMS backed by an API, all new content and new designs (using Bootstrap3).

### [3.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v3)

Coming to the end of my degree in early 2017 I wanted to use my portfolio to aid getting my first graduate job, but knew it needs to be top quality therefore added new content, integrated SCSS, animate.css &amp; wow.js.

### [4.x](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v4)

Having been in a commercial job developing, I used the new knowledge gained on developing at production level to majorly overhaul my site - this included refactor to conform to various coding standards, all custom styles & updated content. This project started in the summer of 2017 and finished in the summer of 2018.
